This is a clone appliaction of amazon that i created only to showcase my skills as a developer to my employers because of getting rejected due to lack of experience. I have created this application Using ReactNative, javascript, javs, html and css. I have used firebase for user authentication and have activated authentication by email and password. The app is not published due to copyright and all copyrights goes with amazon.
If you want to know more,the detailed video of me explaining the app is also here, https://stlawrencecollege.sharepoint.com/sites/combinedstudy/Shared%20Documents/General/Recordings/View%20Only/Meeting%20in%20_General_-20220612_002541-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?web=1
